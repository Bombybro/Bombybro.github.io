        <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>My name is Reece. I'm 16. I usually go by Bombybro online. I really like gaming. I've been gaming my whole life.
            My dad got me into gaming when I was around 2, making me play the original Super Mario Bros. I was gonna put my goals here and then I remembered I have a whole other page for that XD.
            I'm gonna fill the rest of this page with some of my favorite things. My favorite band is Ninja S*x Party. My favorite song right now is Out of Time by Blur. My favorite genre of music is Grunge.
            My favorite game of all time is Skate 3. My favorite game I'm playing right now is Black Ops 6.
